# Problem 1 

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of: 
* A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
* A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
* A (length-10) character vector
* A (length-10) factor vector

```{r Problem_1}

problem1_df = tibble(
  random_sample = runif(10,0,5)
  greater2_logical = which(random_sample > 2)
  vector_character = character(length = 10)
  vector_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "low", "high", "low", "high", "low", "high", "low", "high"))
)

```
